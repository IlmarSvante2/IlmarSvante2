> “My heart isn’t broken—it simply chose to stop mending. Like a weary violin, it sighs in silence. Everyone remembers my name, yet no one remembers the one I once tried to become. I am not forgiving—I am just tired of fighting. But you never let me rest. You only made the pain grow louder.”  
> — Ilmar
